# kdigger

`kdigger`, short for "Kubernetes digger", is a context discovery tool for
Kubernetes penetration testing. This tool is a compilation of various plugins
called buckets to facilitate pentesting Kubernetes from inside a pod.

Please note that this is not an ultimate pentest tool on Kubernetes. Some
plugins perform really simple actions, that could be performed manually by
calling the `mount` command or listing all devices present in dev with `ls
/dev` for example. But some others automate scanning processes, such as the
admission controller scanner. In the end, this tool aims to humbly speed up the
pentesting process.

## Installation

### Via releases

For installation instructions from binaries please visit the [Releases
Page](https://github.com/quarkslab/kdigger/releases).

### Build from source

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/quarkslab/kdigger
$ make
```

Then you can move the binary somewhere included in your PATH, for example:

```bash
$ sudo install kdigger /usr/local/bin
```

### Via Go

```bash
$ go get github.com/quarkslab/kdigger
```

## Usage

What you generally want to do is running all the buckets with `dig all` or just
`d a`:
```bash
$ kdigger dig all
```

Help is provided by the CLI itself, just type `kdigger` to see the options:

```console
$ kdigger
kdigger is an extensible CLI tool to dig around when you are in a Kubernetes
cluster. For that you can use multiples buckets. Buckets are plugins that can
scan specific aspects of a cluster or bring expertise to automate the Kubernetes
pentest process.

Usage:
  kdigger [command]

Available Commands:
  dig         Use all buckets or specific ones
  help        Help about any command
  ls          List available buckets or describe specific ones
  version     Print the version information

Flags:
  -h, --help            help for kdigger
  -o, --output string   Output format. One of: human|json. (default "human")
  -w, --width int       Width for the human output (default 140)

Use "kdigger [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

Make sure to check out the help on the ``dig`` command to see all the available
flags:

```console
$ kdigger dig
This command runs buckets, special keyword "all" or "a" runs all registered
buckets. You can find information about all buckets with the list command. To
run one or more specific buckets, just input their names or aliases as
arguments.

Usage:
  kdigger dig [buckets] [flags]

Aliases:
  dig, d

Flags:
  -a, --active              Enable all buckets that might have side effect on environment.
      --admission-force     Force creation of pods to scan admission even without cleaning rights. (this flag is specific to the admission bucket)
  -c, --color               Enable color in output. (default true if output is human)
  -h, --help                help for dig
      --kubeconfig string   (optional) absolute path to the kubeconfig file (default "/home/mahe/.kube/config")
  -n, --namespace string    Kubernetes namespace to use. (default to the namespace in the context)

Global Flags:
  -o, --output string   Output format. One of: human|json. (default "human")
  -w, --width int       Width for the human output (default 140)
```

## Details

### Usage warning

Be careful when running this tool, some checks have side effects, like
scanning your available syscalls or trying to create pods to scan the
admission control. By default these checks will **not** run without the
`--active` or `-a` flag.

For example, syscalls scans may succeed to perform some syscalls with
empty arguments, and it can alter your environment or configuration. For
instance, if the `hostname` syscall is successful, it will replace the
hostname with the empty string. So please, **NEVER** run with
sufficient permissions (as root for example) directly on your machine.

### Results warning

Some tests are based on details of implementation or side effects on the
environment that might be subject to changes in the future. So be cautious with
the results. For example, CoreDNS is considering removing the wildcard feature,
see [CoreDNS issue 4984]( https://github.com/coredns/coredns/issues/4984).

On top of that, some results might need some experience to be understood and
analyzed. To take a specific example, if you are granted the ``CAP_SYS_ADMIN``
capability inside a Kubernetes container, there is a good chance that it is
because you are running in a privileged container. But you should definitely
confirm that by looking at the number of devices available or the other
capabilities that you are granted. Indeed, it might be necessary to get
``CAP_SYS_ADMIN`` to be privileged but itâ€™s not sufficient and if it is your
goal, you can easily trick the results by crafting very specific pods that
might look confusing regarding this tool results.

It might not be the most sophisticated tool to pentest a Kubernetes cluster,
but you can see this as a *Kubernetes pentest 101 compilation*!

### Why another tool?

I started researching Kubernetes security a few months ago and participated in
the [2021 Europe KubeCon Cloud-Native Security Day
CTF](https://controlplaneio.github.io/kubecon-2021-sig-security-day-ctf/). I
learned a lot by watching various security experts conferences and
demonstrations and this CTF was a really beginner-friendly entry point to
practice what I learned in theory. During a live solving session, I had the
opportunity to see how Kubernetes security experts were trying to solve the
challenge, how they were thinking, what they were looking for.

So I decided to create a tool that compiles most of the checks we usually do as
pentesters when in a Kubernetes pod to acquire information very quickly. There
already are various tools out there. For example, a lot of experts were using
[amicontained](https://github.com/genuinetools/amicontained), a famous
container introspection tool by Jessie Frazelle. This tool is truly awesome,
but some features are outdated, like the PID namespace detection, and it is not
specialized in Kubernetes, it is only a container tool that can already give a
lot of hints about your Kubernetes situation.

That is why, in kdigger, I included most of amicontained features. You can:

- Try to guess your container runtime.
- See your capabilities.
- Scan for namespace activation and configuration.
- Scan for the allowed syscalls.

But you can also do more Kubernetes specific operations:

- Retrieve service account token.
- Scan token permissions.
- List interesting environment variables.
- List available devices.
- Retrieve all available services in a cluster.
- Scan the admission controller chain!

Anyway, this tool is obviously not an *automatically hack your Kubernetes
cluster* application, it is mostly just a compilation of tedious tasks that can
be performed automatically very quickly. You still need a lot of expertise to
interpret the digest and understand what the various outputs mean. And also,
during pentest and challenges, you do not always have Internet access to pull
your favorite toolchain, so you can also see this compilation as a checklist
that you can somehow perform manually with a basic installation and a shell.

### How this tool is built?

In addition to all the available features, this tool was built with a plugin
design so that it can be easily extended by anyone that wants to bring some
expertises.

For example, you are a security researcher on Kubernetes, and when you are
doing CTFs or pentesting real infrastructure, you are often performing specific
repetitive actions that could be automated or at least compiled with others.
You can take a look at `/pkg/plugins/template/template.go` to bootstrap your
own plugins and propose them to the project to extend the features! You only
need a name, optionally some aliases, a description and filling the `Run()`
function with the actual logic.

### Areas for improvement

The expertize proposed by the tool could be refined and more precise. For now
it's mostly dumping raw data for most of the buckets and rely on the user to
understand what it implies.

Generally the output format is not the best and could be reworked. The human
format via array lines does not fit all the use cases. The tool also proposes a
JSON output format, it has the advantage to exist but is really quirky and uses
arrays so extracting information might be a bit unpredictable.

### How can I experience with this tool?

Good news! We created a mini Kubernetes CTF with basic steps to experience with
the tool and resolve quick challenges. For more information go to the
[minik8s-ctf repository](https://github.com/quarkslab/minik8s-ctf).

You can list and describe the available buckets (or plugins) with `kdigger
list` or `kdigger ls`:

```

### Admission

Admission scans the admission controller chain by creating specific pods to
find what is prevented or not. The idea behind this bucket is to check, after
you learned that you have `create pods` ability, if no admission controller
like a PodSecurityPolicy or another is blocking you to create node privilege
escalation pods. Like mounting the host filesystem, or the host PID namespace,
or just a privileged container for example.

This bucket currently automatically tries to create:
- a privileged pod
- a privilege escalation pod
- a host network pod
- a host path pod
- a run as root pod
- a host PID pod

So, if you are granted rights to `create pods`, you can check the presence of
any admission controller that might restrict you.

### Authorization

Authorization checks your API permissions with the current context or the
available token. If you use kdigger inside a pod as planned, it will check and
use the service account token that is normally mounted inside the pod. Then it
will basically operate exactly the same operation as if you do `kubectl auth
can-i --list` and display the result.

### Capabilities

Capabilities list all capabilities in all sets and displays dangerous
capabilities in red.

Basically, in a non-privileged container, the result might look like that:
```text
### CAPABILITIES ###
Comment: The bounding set contains 14 caps, it seems that you are running a non-privileged container.

+-------------+----------------------------------------------------+
```

This bucket might be especially useful to spot critical capabilities that can
help you to escalate your privileges. This can be a good hint on whether you
are running inside a privileged container or not.

### Devices

Devices show the list of devices available in the container. This one is
straightforward, it's equivalent to just `ls /dev`. Nevertheless, the number of
available devices can also be a good hint on running in a privileged container
or not.

### Environment

Environment checks the presence of Kubernetes related environment variables and
shows them. Like always, it's not sufficient, but detecting Kubernetes related
environment variables can give you a pretty good idea that you are running in a
Kubernetes cluster. That might be useful if you want to quickly find out where
you are. Of course, this one is easy to confuse, by just exporting some
environment variable or removing some.

### Mount

Mount show all mounted devices in the container. This is equivalent to use the
`mount` command directly but the number of mounted devices and reading path can
show you mounted volumes, configmap or even secrets inside the pod.

### PIDNamespace

PIDNamespace analyses the PID namespace of the container in the context of
Kubernetes. Detecting the PID namespace is almost impossible so the idea of
this bucket is to scan the `/proc` folder to search for specific processes
like:
* `pause`: it might signify that you are sharing the PID namespace between all
  the containers composing the pod.
* `kubelet`: it might signify that you are sharing the PID namespace with the
  host.

By the way, the detection in
[amicontained](https://github.com/genuinetools/amicontained) is based on the
device number of the namespace file, a detail of implementation which is no
longer reliable and most of the time wrong. This is why I tried a different
approach.

### Processes

Processes analyses the running processes in your PID namespace. It is similar
to any `ps` command that list all processes like `ps -e` or `ps -A`. It gives
you the information of the number of running processes and if the first one is
systemd.

### Runtime

Runtime finds clues to identify which container runtime is running the
container. This one is calling exactly the same code that the one in
[amicontained](https://github.com/genuinetools/amicontained). It is using a
package of the [genuinetools/bpfd](https://github.com/genuinetools/bpfd)
project to spot artefacts about container runtime that could betray their
presence.

Please note that this is a 3 year old part of that code and that it makes no
distinction between Docker and containerd.

### Services

Services uses CoreDNS wildcards feature to discover every service available in
the cluster. In fact, it appears that CoreDNS, that is now widely used in
Kubernetes cluster proposes a wildcards features. You can learn more about it
[here in the
documentation](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/blob/master/plugin/kubernetes/README.md#wildcards).

This bucket is extremely useful to perform discovery really fast in a
Kubernetes cluster. The DNS will kindly give you every service domain present
in the cluster.

### Syscalls

Syscalls scans most of the syscalls to detect which are blocked and allowed.
This one is also using a lot of the
[amicontained](https://github.com/genuinetools/amicontained) code base except
that it also banned the `SYS_PTRACE` scan that causes a racing condition that
can hang the program forever.

This is one really nice way to see if you are in a privileged container with a
lot of capabilities quickly: the list of blocked syscall might be almost empty.

### Token

Token checks for the presence of a service account token in the filesystem.
Then it dumps the stuff it finds in `/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount`
which is composed of the service account token itself, the namespace and the CA
certificate of the kube API server.

You might want to use the `-o json` flag here and use `jq` to get that token
fast!

### UserID

UserID retrieves UID, GID and their corresponding names. It also gives
`homeDir` as a bonus! Unfortunately, we can list all group IDs without CGO
enabled. This is almost (because `id` is better) equivalent to run the `id`
command directly.

### UserNamespace

UserNamespace analyses the user namespace configuration. The user namespace is
transparent and can be easily detected. It is even possible to read the mapping
between the current user namespace and the outer namespace. Unfortunately for
now, user namespace cannot be used with Kubernetes.

### Version

Version dumps the API server version informations. It access the `/version`
path that is accessible even by unauthenticated users. So even without a
service account token you can request this information. You can get more
information on what you can access as an `system:unauthenticated` user with
`kubectl describe clusterrolebinding | grep unauthenticated -B 9` for example.
You may encounter the `system:public-info-viewer` cluster role, you can
describe it with `kubectl describe clusterrole system:public-info-viewer` and
display:

```text
Name:         system:public-info-viewer
Labels:       kubernetes.io/bootstrapping=rbac-defaults
